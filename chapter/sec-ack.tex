First and foremost, I want to show my gratitude to my supervisor and mentor Prof. Huamin Qu, who gave me the strongest support to my research, career and life. I really enjoy the short talks with Prof. Qu in his sunny office, which release me from my difficulties many times.  It’s his guidance and cultivation that help me to know what is research and myself. He provided me with great opportunities to collaborate with many great researchers and extent my horizons. Even today, I still feel I was really lucky to send him my first email seeking the opportunity to visit VisLab in 2014, when the group is far smaller than what it is now. In this five years, I witnessed the growth of our group and the great achievement we have. I am really appreciate that Prof. Qu bring me to fantastic group.
