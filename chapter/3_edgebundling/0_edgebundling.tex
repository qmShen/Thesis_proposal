\chapter{Route-Aware Edge Bundling for Visualizing Origin-Destination Trails in Urban Traffic}\label{chap:c2_intro}

The visualizations for the large amounts of Origin-destination(OD) trails always cause serious clutter issues, which can be mitigated by edge bundling techniques. 
In this chapter, we first identify inconsiderate settings of conventional kernel density estimation edge bundling (KDEEB) when applied to urban traffic data, including non-optimal kernel size and road neglect. 
Then we present route aware edge bundling (RAEB) specifically designed for the OD trails bundling, which addresses these limitations by introducing a comprehensive pipeline comprising preprocessing, bundling and evaluation processes. A series of new parameters, together with adaptions of existing ones, are employed in the pipeline.
