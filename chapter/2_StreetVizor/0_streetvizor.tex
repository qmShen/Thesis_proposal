\chapter{Visual Exploration of Human-Scale Urban Forms Based on Street Views}\label{chap:c1_intro}
Human-scale urban forms indicate urban environments that human can see, smell and touch in their daily lives. The study of urban forms can help planners develop high-quality urban spaces through evidence-based design.
Traditionally, the analysis suffers a lot of challenges including the inefficient data collections, and lack of quantitative analysis methods.
In this chapter, we present StreetVizor, an interactive visual analytics system that helps planners leverage their domain knowledge in exploring human-scale urban forms. We integrate visualization techniques with machine learning models to facilitate the detection of street view patterns. 
Our system presents two-stage visual exploration: 
1) an AOI Explorer for the visual comparison of spatial distributions and quantitative measurements in two areas-of-interest (AOIs) at city- and region-scales;
2) and a Street Explorer with a novel parallel coordinate plot for the exploration of the fine-grained details of the urban forms at the street-scale.
We illustrate the applicability of our approach with case studies on the real-world datasets of four cities, i.e., Hong Kong, Singapore, Greater London and New York City.
Interviews with domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in facilitating various analytical tasks.
